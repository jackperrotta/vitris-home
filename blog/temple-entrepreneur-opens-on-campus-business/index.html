                    <p>The end of August marks the start of school for millions of students across the country and soon enough Temple’s classes will be full steam ahead. We know all the papers and exams can be draining, especially when you have a broken phone that needs fixing. To ease you back into the back-to-school groove and help you with all your broken device needs, we’ve taken the time to interview Jesse Dilaura, founder and owner of Repair U, a phone repair shop right on Temple’s campus!</p>
                    <h4>Tell us how you started Repair U</h4>
                    <p>“I started repairing phones out of my dorm room on Temple’s campus. Out of necessity to pay rent, I taught myself how to repair all sorts of devices through Youtube videos and a kiosk I used to work at in the mall. Because I was offering such affordable prices, right on campus, the demand for repairs shot up, and my phone was ringing off the hook. Next thing you know, I had a real business fixing phones for students.”</p>
                    <h4>What are the advantages of getting your smartphones fixed through Repair U versus another shop?</h4>
                    <p>“The fact that we are located right on campus is the first advantage. No need to Uber and wait hours at an Apple store; we are right next to all the students' favorite lunch trucks! We are also affordable, offering accessories and cell phone repair cheaper than anyone in the city!”</p>
                    <h4>What is the average cost to fix a broken screen through Repair U?</h4>
                    <p>“The average cost is around $90. Some models are as cheap as $50, but it all depends what kind of phone you have. Check out our website at <a href="https://repairuphilly.com" target="_blank">www.repairuphilly.com</a> to get a full list of prices.”</p>
                    <h4>What are your hours/days of operation?</h4>
                    <p>“We are open 10 am to 5 pm Monday through Friday. We are also available by appointment during the weekend. Customers can schedule appointments through our website.”</p>
                    <h4>Are you planning on doing any back-to-school promotions?</h4>
                    <p>“Yes! We are giving out free tempered glass screen protectors on all iPhone 7 and 7+ screen replacements, as well as $5 off all tempered glass screen protectors, no purchase necessary.”</p>
                    <p>For more on Jesse and Repair U, visit his website at <a href="https://repairuphilly.com" target="_blank">www.repairuphilly.com</a> or stop by the Repair U truck located at 2021 N. 13th Street, at the corner of 13th and Norris.</p>

We know all the papers and exams can be draining, especially when you have a broken phone that needs fixing. To ease you back into the back-to-school groove and help you with all your broken device needs, we’ve taken the time to interview Jesse Dilaura, founder and owner of Repair U, a phone repair shop right on Temple’s campus!
        
            Tell us how you started Repair U
            
            I started repairing phones out of my dorm room on Temple’s campus. Out of necessity to pay rent, I taught myself how to repair all sorts of devices through Youtube videos and a kiosk I used to work at in the mall. Because I was offering such affordable prices, right on campus, the demand for repairs shot up, and my phone was ringing off the hook. Next thing you know, I had a real business fixing phones for students.
            
            What are the advantages of getting your smartphones fixed through Repair U versus another shop?
            
            The fact that we are located right on campus is the first advantage. No need to Uber and wait hours at an Apple store; we are right next to all the students' favorite lunch trucks! We are also affordable, offering accessories and cell phone repair cheaper than anyone in the city!
            
            
            What is the average cost to fix a broken screen through Repair U? 
            
            The average cost is around $90. Some models are as cheap as $50, but it all depends what kind of phone you have. Check out our website at https://www.repairu.tech to get a full list of prices.
            
            What are your hours/days of operation?
            
            We are open 10 am to 5 pm Monday through Friday. We are also available by appointment during the weekend. Customers can schedule appointments through our website.
            
            Are you planning on doing any back-to-school promotions?
            
            Yes! We are giving out free tempered glass screen protectors on all iPhone 7 and 7+ screen replacements, as well as $5 off all tempered glass screen protectors, no purchase necessary.
