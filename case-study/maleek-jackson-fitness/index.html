                        Maleek Jackson knows all about pain and struggle. He was born in the heart of South Philadelphia and became involved in a life of crime during his teenage years. At the tender age of 16 he was sentenced to 8-16 years in the State Penitentiary. After spending ten years of his life in prison, Maleek decided to start all over. He discovered his love for boxing and fitness in prison, and he decided to turn his dreams into a reality. Today, Maleek is considered the top personal trainer in the Philadelphia area.

                    <p class="wow slideInUp mt-2 text-justify">
                        Like so many small business owners, Maleek needed a website that would deliver great results. His website goals were all about building brand awareness, growing sales and improving conversions.
                        <br><br>
                        He was looking at a number of possible solutions to help promote his business, but he needed to find a firm who could take on responsibility for marketing so that he has time to focus on other aspects of business development. When Maleek started talking to us it became clear that we could manage all the online marketing and our prices were very competitive. Our full suite of services, including web design, customer service, local search engine optimization and mobile responsive solutions met his needs perfectly.

                    <p class="wow slideInUp mt-2 text-justify">
                        We always take the time at the start of a project to understand our client’s requirements and the goals they have set for their website. We then work with each client to create a website which looks incredible, works across different platforms and is designed to be an effective digital marketing platform. 
                        <br><br>
                        After talking to Maleek we created a beautifully designed website which really sells the business, and we included an online appointment booking system. This additional feature would make it easy for people to arrange a training session immediately and also provided a method to be able to measure the effectiveness of the website.

                        Maleek is delighted with his new website: “Vitris is the best website development company in Philly, they've increased our sales over 40% in the past couple months".
                        <br><br>
                        Around half of the 1,700 visitors to maleekjacksonfitness.com each month find the website from organic searches (around 50%) or from social media (around 40%). These impressive figures show how well our websites reach new audiences. Most of these visitors are from the Philadelphia area, reinforcing the way we design our websites to reach our client’s most important target markets.
